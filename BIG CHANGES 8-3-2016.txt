Hey dude I'll try to keep this brief, here are the additions I put into the game today:


****NOTE: To test my changes, run ApplicationTest instead of Application
****I should have created a BoardTest but I forgot. Major functionality of Board hasn't been changed too drastically,
***I'm pretty sure Application.java still runs it fine. 
---------------
>Support for extra panel on the side that can hold basic components like pictures, textfields, buttons, etc.
	-middle border can be resized but I have it set to stay put for now
	-both Board and (new class) SidePanel are now both part of SplitPane.java, which is a class of type JSplitPane that
	 lets you hold multiple panes inside of one. "SplitePane.java" that I made also creates the frame that will hold the game.
	-ApplicationTest.java is now chiefly for housing the main() function that will start "run()" and start the program's thread.

>Level editing capabilities: 
	-click an entity's bounding box to select it. Hold and drag after that to move it around the screen.
	-To deselect it, click anywhere else once.
	-play with physics box, it's fucking hilarious


>Laser now follows mouse drag for testing purposes, but I left the original player-homing code there but commented if we want it back.

>Full mouse support inside of Board. Includes clicking, dragging, mouse press and mouse release. Also has mouse-moving support 
 (just reacting to the cursor moving) but I'm not currently using that.
	-All of the MouseListener event definitions inside my MouseHandlerClass can possibly be moved out of Board if
	we feel like Board.java is getting too colossal.







Really excited about where we can go from here. We'll have to see about saving and loading positions of entities in a .config file
